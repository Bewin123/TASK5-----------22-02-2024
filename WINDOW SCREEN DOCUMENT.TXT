                                                                                   Read about the difference between windows, screens, and document in Javascript. 

In JavaScript, window, screen, and document refer to different objects and concepts related to the browser environment. Let's explore the differences between them:
window:
The window object represents the browser window or frame that contains the HTML document.
It is the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment, and it contains properties and methods that deal with the browser window itself, such as dimensions, location, and navigation.
It serves as the global context for JavaScript code running in the browser.
Example:
console.log(window.innerWidth);  // Get the inner width of the browser window
window.alert("Hello, World!");   // Display an alert in the browser window
screen:
The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor.
It provides information about the screen's characteristics, such as width, height, and color depth.
It is a property of the window object, so you can access it through window.screen.
Example:
console.log(window.screen.width);   // Get the width of the user's screen
console.log(window.screen.height);  // Get the height of the user's screen
document:
The document object represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
It provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document, such as manipulating elements, handling events, and modifying the structure of the HTML.
It is part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and serves as the interface between JavaScript and the HTML document.
Example:
let heading = document.getElementById("main-heading");  // Get an element by its ID
heading.innerHTML = "New Heading";                       // Change the content of the element
